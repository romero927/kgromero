# Active Context: Kyle Romero's Personal Website

## Current Focus
- Setting up the memory bank for the project to maintain context between Cline sessions
- Establishing documentation for the existing project structure and components
- Identifying potential areas for improvement or enhancement

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Documented project overview, technical stack, and architecture

## Current State
The project appears to be a functioning personal website/portfolio for Kyle Romero built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS. The site includes:

- Personal information and about me section
- Professional experience timeline
- Skills showcase
- Contact information
- Resume available in multiple formats
- Potentially a travel globe visualization using Three.js

The project uses modern web technologies including Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2, Tailwind CSS, and various UI component libraries like Flowbite.

## Active Decisions
- How to best organize and maintain the memory bank documentation
- Identifying priority areas for potential improvements
- Determining if any features are incomplete or need enhancement

## Considerations
- The website should maintain a balance between professional presentation and personal expression
- Performance optimization may be needed, especially for the Three.js components
- Accessibility should be a priority to ensure the site is usable by all visitors
- Mobile responsiveness is essential for a modern portfolio site

## Next Steps
1. **Review Site Functionality**: Run the development server and review the current state of the website
2. **Identify Enhancement Opportunities**: Look for areas where the site could be improved
3. **Update Documentation**: Continue to refine the memory bank documentation as more is learned about the project
4. **Consider Testing**: Evaluate adding testing to ensure site reliability
5. **Performance Audit**: Consider running performance audits to identify optimization opportunities

## Questions to Resolve
- Is the website currently deployed? If so, where?
- Are there any specific features or sections that need improvement?
- Are there any planned features not yet implemented?
- What are the priorities for future development?
